# SLEAP-Based Social Behavior Analysis in Mice

## Overview

This project presents a deep learning-based pipeline for **multi-animal pose estimation** and **automated behavioral analysis** in mice. It leverages the SLEAP framework to achieve robust tracking of social interactions such as sniffing, grooming, and mounting. The pipeline is designed for scalability, reproducibility, and efficiency - providing neuroscientists with a high-throughput method to quantify behavior with temporal precision across groups, sexes, and individual traits.

## Technical Architecture

### Neural Network Configuration

- **Backbone**: U-Net encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for fine-grained spatial localization of keypoints.
- **Tracking Strategy**: Top-down multi-animal pipeline using:
  - **Centroid Model** for instance localization
  - **Centered-Instance Model** for keypoint prediction per detected mouse
- **Keypoint Set**: Nose, neck (anchor), left/right ears, and tail base
- **Loss Functions**: Combined confidence map and part affinity field losses with custom sigma and anchor configurations

### Training Workflow

- **Frame Sampling**: Smart sampling of high-variance frames using SLEAP’s GUI tools
- **Manual Labeling**: ~20 frames per video annotated using human-in-the-loop corrections
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Max Instances: 2
  - Sigma: 2.5
  - Anchor Part: Neck
  - Cross-validation split: 90:10
- **Label Efficiency**: Achieved robust generalization with as few as 200–650 labeled frames
- **Convergence Time**: Model trained in ~45–60 minutes per dataset using an NVIDIA GPU

### Inference & Export

- Processed full-length videos with **>600 FPS inference throughput**
- Generated `.h5` files containing instance tracks, keypoint confidence scores, and behavior timestamps

## Behavioral Classification System

Behavior identification was implemented by analyzing spatial relationships between tracked body parts. The system automatically extracts and quantifies:

### **Detected Metrics & Features**

- **Event Frequency**  
  Total count of each defined event per session (e.g., sniffing, mounting).

- **Latency to First Occurrence**  
  Time and frame index when each behavior first appears in the recording.

- **Event Duration & Bout Length**  
  Duration (ms/s) of continuous behavior bouts; average, median, and variance to quantify typical interaction lengths.

- **Inter-Event Intervals (IEIs)**  
  Time gaps between successive events of the same type – insightful for behavioral pacing and rhythm analysis.

- **Temporal Patterns in Time Bins**  
  Minute-by-minute histograms to capture behavioral unfolding and session-specific peaks (e.g., sniffing peaks early on).

- **Co-occurrence & Transition Probabilities**  
  Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-style transition matrices showing likelihoods of moving between behaviors (e.g., sniff → chase → grooming), useful for sequence analysis.

- **Spatial Proximity Distributions**  
  Distance histograms between body parts during events – for example, how close noses get during sniffing vs mounting.

- **Orientation & Angle Analysis**  
  Head-turn angles during nose-to-nose or chasing events reveal approach orientation tendencies.

- **Velocity & Acceleration Profiles**  
  Kinematic measures (instantaneous speed, acceleration) around events – capturing behaviors like rearing and chasing that involve rapid movement.

- **Occlusion Robustness Validation**  
  Flagging frames with occluded keypoints; statistical reporting on recovery speed and confidence consistency.

- **Identity-Tracking Accuracy**  
  Continuous ID-tracking across frames allows assessing ID switches, persistence rates, and gap resilience – critical when animals cross or interact closely.

- **Real-Time Behavior Detection**  
  System latency measurable to classify behaviors in real time (<10 ms threshold) – enabling possibilities for closed-loop experimental interventions.

### **Example Insights**

- **Sniffing Behavior**  
  - Average bout: 2.1 s ± 0.8 s  
  - IEI: 15 s ± 3 s  
  - Frequency peak in first minute, tapering off thereafter

- **Mounting Episodes**  
  - Rare (<5 instances/session), but longest bout durations (~8 s) and high inter-individual variability

- **Chasing Initiation Speed**  
  - Mean latency from sniff to chase: ~0.75 s  
  - Often occurs when animals are oriented within ±30°

- **Rearing & Locomotion Tracking**  
  - Velocity threshold-based detection: >5 cm/s for locomotion, vertical displacement >3 cm for rearing  
  - Bout duration and spatial location distributions plotted on heatmaps across arenas

- **Behavioral Transitions**  
  - Transition matrix shows 40% probability of grooming following sniffing, but <10% for sniff → mount

### **Supported Behaviors**

- Nose-to-nose  
- Anogenital (AG) sniffing  
- Nose-to-neck  
- Nose-to-left/right ear  
- Grooming  
- Mounting  
- Chasing  
- Fighting  
- Rearing  
- Locomotion and postural shifts
